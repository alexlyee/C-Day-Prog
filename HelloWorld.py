# Steps to beaming this project down.
#########################################
# git clone ADDRESS //// Replace ADDRESS with the git project link that can be found here: https://github.com/alexlyee/C-Day-Prog/tree/master
# git cd PROJECT NAME //// In this case, C-Day-Prog
# git init //// just to be safe
# git status //// to check if it is in sync with the remote repository that we just beamed down


# If you would like to beam this down and edit it, you must first fork it and them clone it from your repository (repo).
# After doing that, here are the steps to commiting your updates and pushing them to GitHub.
#########################################
# git status //// ensure that your files are all staged for "commit".
# git commit -m "WRITE YOUR UPDATE CONCISESLY HERE" //// a commit is essentially an update. you determine when you want to do them. But be careful, once you push them out they are hard to undo!!
# git push //// this will push your update(s) to your repository. In our case, this is hosted on GitHub!
